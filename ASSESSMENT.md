# Chapter One Take Home Assessment

## Overview

Build a **Task Manager** app with **React Native** (Expo). Implement add task, mark complete, delete task, and a list of tasks. Apply your own design taste and keep the UI clear and usable.

**Assignment document**: [https://chapter-one.tiiny.site/](https://chapter-one.tiiny.site/)

## Requirements

### Core Features

- [ ] **Add Task** — User types a short description and adds it to the list
- [ ] **Mark Complete** — User can mark a task as done; done tasks look different (e.g. strikethrough, different color)
- [ ] **Delete Task** — User can remove a task from the list
- [ ] **Task List** — Show all tasks (done and not done) in a list
- [ ] **Feedback** — When the user completes or deletes a task, something visible happens (e.g. list updates, short message or animation)

### Tech Rules

- **State**: Local component state only (e.g. `useState`). No Redux, no global store, no database.
- **UI**: Default React Native components are fine. One UI library is optional.

### Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository** or **.zip file** — Clean, well-structured code
2. **Submission** — Per guidelines in the assignment document at [chapter-one.tiiny.site](https://chapter-one.tiiny.site/)
3. **Email** — Send to **eng@startchapterone.com** with subject: **`[Your Name] - React Native Tech Screen`**

**Timeline**: 4 days from receipt, due **2:00 PM EST**
